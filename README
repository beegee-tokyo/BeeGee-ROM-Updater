ROMUpdater is meant to be an Android universal ROM updater.
It checks for the build.prop's ro.build.display.id and
downloads a series of JSON files that describe and give
a link to the available versions (from the next one
upwards, if available). It can also execute the most
common Recovery actions (via /cache/recovery/command
and extendedcommand), for example Nandroid backup,
cache/data wipe, or simply enter the removery mode.

This application requires root.

ROMUpdater is a free software and its source code
is being distributed under the GNU GPL v.3.

You can find the final APK in the market as
